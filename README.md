# Detect and Enable HDR
An extension to automatically detect games with HDR support and enable HDR for those games. It is strongly recommended to use this extension with the [PCGamingWiki Metadata Provider](https://github.com/sharkusmanch/playnite-pcgamingwiki-metadata-provider) extension, which is capable of determining which games support HDR by adding an "HDR" feature to those games.
